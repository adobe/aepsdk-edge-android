## About this project

The Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network mobile extension allows you to send data to the Experience Platform Edge Network from a mobile application. This extension allows you to implement Adobe Experience Cloud capabilities in a more robust way, serve multiple Adobe solutions though one network call, and simultaneously forward this information to Adobe Experience Platform.

The Edge Network mobile extension is an extension for the [Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK](https://developer.adobe.com/client-sdks) and requires the Mobile Core and Services extensions for event handling, as well as the Identity for Edge Network extension for handling identities, such as `ECID`.

### Installation

Integrate the Edge Network mobile extension into your app by following the [getting started guide](Documentation/getting-started.md).

### Development

#### Open the project

To open and run the project, open the `code/settings.gradle` file in Android Studio.

#### Run the test application

To configure and run the test app for this project, follow the [getting started guide for the test app](Documentation/getting-started-test-app.md).

#### Code format

This project uses the code formatting tools [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/tree/main/plugin-gradle) with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Formatting is applied when the project is built from Gradle and is checked when changes are submitted to the CI build system.

Prettier requires [Node version](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/) 10+
To enable the Git pre-commit hook to apply code formatting on each commit, run the following to update the project's git config `core.hooksPath`:
```
make init
```
